- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://gitlab.cim.rhul.ac.uk/zfac125/Tim-Adams-2018-ZFAC125-100900214-FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

- [ ] [Set up project integrations](https://gitlab.cim.rhul.ac.uk/zfac125/Tim-Adams-2018-ZFAC125-100900214-FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

- [ ] [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)

## YOUR FASHION


## Description
Building a website (online clothes shop) for customers to explore, search and buy new clothes. The website will allow staff member to add/ remove items as well as allowing managers to edit prices and apply discounts.

## Work Progress 
From 25 - 1 Oct 23 I have read the project specifications to understand the requirements and searched for the best approach to construct the website.
On 28 Sep had a meeting with my Supervisor and I got some advises on how to intergrade the login system and sugestions on where to deploy the website as well as other advises.
On 2nd Oct started to build the skeleton index page with some styling.
On 10 Oct built the Men wear skeleton page with some styling.
On 14 Oct integrating search bar to the index.html page. 
On 22nd Oct corrected the project name as advised.
Today 23rd Oct I made the navigation bar and the slideshow ready and working to get the rest of the pages ready.
27th Oct learned how to correctly style the navbar from https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp . 
Oct 29th done all the html pages.
Today on Nov 2nd I created the products cards and faced with styling problem so I have read about on https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_product_card.asp and https://codepen.io/Aldykusuma/pen/mdrBJbd to learn how to solve it.
On the 8th of November I wrote the JS code for the shopping basket but I encounter an issue with loading the selected items into the shopping basket I think my approach need some improvement on how to inject HTML code into JS code.


## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
For any question please contact me on zfac125@live.rhul.ac.uk 

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
