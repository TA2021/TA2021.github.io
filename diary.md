## Description
Building a website (online clothes shop) for customers to explore, search and buy new clothes. The website will allow staff member to add/ remove items as well as allowing managers to edit prices and apply discounts.

## Work Progress 
From 25 - 1 Oct 23 I have read the project specifications to understand the requirements and searched for the best approach to construct the website.
On 28 Sep had a meeting with my Supervisor and I got some advises on how to intergrade the login system and sugestions on where to deploy the website as well as other advises.
On 2nd Oct started to build the skeleton index page with some styling.
On 10 Oct built the Men wear skeleton page with some styling.
On 14 Oct integrating search bar to the index.html page. 
On 22nd Oct corrected the project name as advised.
Today 23rd Oct I made the navigation bar and the slideshow ready and working to get the rest of the pages ready.
27th Oct learned how to correctly style the navbar from https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp . 
Oct 29th done all the html pages.
Today on Nov 2nd I created the products cards and faced with styling problem so I have read about on https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_product_card.asp and https://codepen.io/Aldykusuma/pen/mdrBJbd to learn how to solve it.
On the 8th of November I wrote the JS code for the shopping basket but I encounter an issue with loading the selected items into the shopping basket I think my approach need some improvement on how to inject HTML code into JS code.
Today 14/11/2023 I have learnt and used the icon codes from https://css.gg/ where I used close, add, and remove icons in the shopping-basket.js file.
20/11/2023 done the 3D Carousel but it has a problem with the slides size(once it moves the size is getting bigger than it suppose to be.)
22/11/2023 started to implement the database using express framework but it is postponded until the payment functionality is complete.
26/11/2023 started to do the payment functionality.
07/12/2023 Work stopped on the project's code due to emergency surgeries however the work will continue during Christmass holidays to put the project back on schedule.
Today 20/01/24 completed the payment functionality but still face a minor issue with the payment button styling, this to be solved in later stage.
26/01/2024 completed the search functionalities but still not fully working becacuse the database has to be implemented first in order to fetch from localHost.
30/01/2024 the connection with the local host has been established so the project is ready to have a DBMS. 
06/02/2024 displaying items from the backend is completed but with issues that is going to be addressed soon.
15/02/2024 working on the search function but still facing fetching problem and I am looking for solution to solve this problem.
18/02/2024 solved most of the search function issues and only one step left to complete this feature which is flatten the products array and the matching the input string with the relevant item.
24/02/2024 solved displaying items on the cart page issue but still another issue with displaying items on the other pages to be sorted and the solution might be by moving all item to the databse so it can be queried accordingly.
02/03/2024 most of the pages are now fetching products from the database, but still have to refactor the function that adding and displaying products to the basket page so that it will functional again.
04/03/2024 work stopped due to health issue, seeking medical help so the work could continue ASAP.
10/03/2024 Start working on the project again, sorting the fetching issue by refactoring the Shopping basket file and deleting the files that is not wanted anymore such as products file.
12/03/2024 created login/register system as well as creating STMP for the notification emails.
21/03/2024 Footer has been implemented with some working functionalities, however the rest of the links will be activated on later phase of the project because at the moment the project just runs on local machine.
25/03/2024 refactored the shopping basket file to simplify the code and eliminate some bugs.
27/03/2024 implemented a new approach to display the shopping basket because the old approach was not ituitive to use.
30/03/2024 fixed a few styling issues and the code is done.
