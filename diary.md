## YOUR FASHION


## Description
Building a website (online clothes shop) for customers to explore, search and buy new clothes. The website will allow staff member to add/ remove items as well as allowing managers to edit prices and apply discounts.

## Work Progress 
From 25 - 1 Oct 23 I have read the project specifications to understand the requirements and searched for the best approach to construct the website.
On 28 Sep had a meeting with my Supervisor and I got some advises on how to intergrade the login system and sugestions on where to deploy the website as well as other advises.
On 2nd Oct started to build the skeleton index page with some styling.
On 10 Oct built the Men wear skeleton page with some styling.
On 14 Oct integrating search bar to the index.html page. 
On 22nd Oct corrected the project name as advised.
Today 23rd Oct I made the navigation bar and the slideshow ready and working to get the rest of the pages ready.
27th Oct learned how to correctly style the navbar from https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp . 
Oct 29th done all the html pages.
Today on Nov 2nd I created the products cards and faced with styling problem so I have read about on https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_product_card.asp and https://codepen.io/Aldykusuma/pen/mdrBJbd to learn how to solve it.
On the 8th of November I wrote the JS code for the shopping basket but I encounter an issue with loading the selected items into the shopping basket I think my approach need some improvement on how to inject HTML code into JS code.
Today 14/11/2023 I have learnt and used the icon codes from https://css.gg/ where I used close, add, and remove icons in the shopping-basket.js file.
20/11/2023 done the 3D Carousel but it has a problem with the slides size(once it moves the size is getting bigger than it suppose to be.)
22/11/2023 started to implement the database using express framework but it is postponded until the payment functionality is complete.
26/11/2023 started to do the payment functionality.
07/12/2023 Work stopped on the project's code due to emergency surgeries however the work will continue during Christmass holidays to put the project back on schedule.
Today 20/01/24 completed the payment functionality but still face a minor issue with the payment button styling, this to be solved in later stage.
26/01/2024 completed the search functionalities but still not fully working becacuse the database has to be implemented first in order to fetch from localHost.
